<h1 >Choosing Your Development Environment</h1>
To follow along with the exercises in this book, you'll 
need a<b> Salesforce account</b>. If
 you're
already a Salesforce customer, you can use a <a href="www.google.com">Force.com <a>
<i>sandbox</i>.
 A sandbox is a copy of your
organization that you can use for testing configurations and training users without 
compromising
the data in your production organization. Salesforce Enterprise
 and Unlimited Editions come
with one free sandbox; users of other editions can use Developer 
Edition to do the exercises.</br></br></br>
If you're new to Salesforce or if you don't want to use a 
sandbox, go to <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">developer.force.com</a>
and sign up for a free Developer Edition account. Developer 
Edition is a fully-functional
version of Salesforce that you can use to develop Salesforce apps.
 Since it's free, there are limits
on the amount of users, bandwidth, and storage you're allowed,
 but it includes all of the features
in Salesforce. When you sign up, you'll also automatically 
become part of the growing
community of Force.com platform developers around the world
