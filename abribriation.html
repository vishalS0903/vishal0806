First, let's learn a little more about our fictional company, Universal Containers.
Universal Containers is a rapidly growing international supplier of container products. The
company produces every kind of container from simple overnight letter mailers to custom
equipment p
Custom Objects
Custom objects are the native components that model the data we need to store in our
Recruiting app. Similar to a database table, a custom object is composed of several fields that
store information such as a job applicant's name, or the maximum salary for a particular position.
However, unlike traditional database tables, we don't need to write any SQL in order to create
cecurity and sharing rules, we'll first specify which custom objects a particular user should
be allowed to create, view, or edit (for example, Candidate and Position), and then which
instances of those objects should be accessible (for example, the records for candidate John
Smith or the Senior Sales Manager position). Controlling our data either with the wide brush
of object-level security or with the more detailed brush of record-level security will give us a
lot of power and flexibility in controlling what users can and can't see.
